Touring Complete Plumbing is a simulator that uses water pressure and pressure activated valves that can be used to implement digital logic functions. 

The user can drop down various types of primitive valves and connect them up with perssure sources and pipes to construct digital or analog systems. 

tcPlumbing includes a library of pre-built circuits such as adders, oscillators, and latches
